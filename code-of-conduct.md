# VEC Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
members and the committee pledge to making participation in the club
a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

The Committee are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

The Committee have the right and responsibility to remove posts
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any member for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

The Committee is also responsible for fulfilling their responsibilities within the Committee while ensuring their own behaviour does not obstruct the ability of the club to support members, or compromise the intgrity of the Club. Responsibilities of a member of the Committee include those detailed under the named role(s) the member holds, and any aditional responsibilities the member has voluntarily accepted.

Miscellanious responsibilities which must be fulfilled by all Committee members are as follows:
* Be contactable via an approved messaging system
* Attend meetings or excuse yourself from the meeting, being able to provide a reason if asked

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both at club events and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the club or its community. Examples of
representing a club or community include using an official club e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of the club may be
further defined and clarified by the committee.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the committee at contact@vec.ac.nz. Or by talking to a
committee member at an event. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated
and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the
circumstances. The committee is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard
to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies
may be posted separately.

Committee members who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the clubs's leadership. A member of the Committee may be voted off of the
Committee by a super majority (greater than or equal to 75% of those who vote, with a
minimum of four votes required). In this case, the entirety of the Committee must be
aware of the vote taking place, and explicitly state which way they vote, or that they
abstain from voting. The member who arranges the vote and the member about whom the voting
is taking place may not vote.

## Student Conduct Statute

Any behaviour that the committee deems could be in violation of the
[Student Conduct Statute](https://www.victoria.ac.nz/documents/policy/student-policy/student-conduct-statute.pdf)
may be reported to the university and further action taken as defined in the statute.

A copy of the statue can be found at https://www.victoria.ac.nz/documents/policy/student-policy/student-conduct-statute.pdf
